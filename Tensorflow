TensorFlow is an open-source software library for dataflow programming across a range of tasks. It is a symbolic math library, and 
also used for machine learning applications such as neural networks. It is used for both research and production at Google, often 
replacing its closed-source predecessor, DistBelief.

TensorFlow was developed by the Google Brain team for internal Google use. It was released under the Apache 2.0 open source license 
on November 9, 2015.
